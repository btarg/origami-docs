# ðŸ“£ Events

{% hint style="info" %}
Both blocks and items use some events by the same name, with them behaving differently depending on the context: for example, `onBroken` is used for both when a block is broken and for when an item breaks as a result of running out of durability.
{% endhint %}

```yaml
# "events" is formatted as a list of event objects:
events:
  - onRightClick: # <-- event name
      commands:
        - say block right clicked!
      cooldown: 20 # <-- cooldown in ticks
  - onBroken:
      commands:
      # this is a list of Minecraft commands, with or without the slash
        - say block broken!
        - say goodbye world!
      # adding a cooldown is optional
```
