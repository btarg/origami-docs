# âœ¨ Item Strings

An Item String consists of a [Material](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html) or the ID of a custom item/block, optionally followed by a count in brackets. `DIAMOND` is one diamond, `origami:rainbow_block(3)` is 3 "rainbow blocks" (the custom block shown above, in item form.)

Custom items must have the prefix `origami:` before their actual names, which come from the name of their respective `.yml` file.
