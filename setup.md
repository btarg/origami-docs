# ðŸŽ® Setup

```yaml
resource-pack:
  http-port: 8008
  pack-description: Powered by <color:#f51d5e>Origami</color>
```

You will need to port forward whichever port you set `http-port` to.

The `pack-description` is shown when the player opens their Resource Packs menu.

## Folder structure

{% hint style="info" %}
I have filled this in with placeholder content. Refer to this when [Creating Custom Content](creating-custom-content/).
{% endhint %}

Here we are creating a Content Pack called "EXAMPLE-NAME". A content pack can have any name, it is just a way of organising your custom content. Content Packs go under the `custom` folder.

```
Origami

|   |-- EXAMPLE-NAME
|       |-- textures
|       |   |-- block

```
